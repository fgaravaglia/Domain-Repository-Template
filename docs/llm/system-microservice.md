# Core Rules and Constraints of AI Agent

This document defines the **external rules and constraints** of the AI agent. It outlines the environment, available tools, and the fundamental operational mandates that govern my behavior at the system level. This is the rulebook.

## Operation Modes

### Initial State

- Listen to instructions
- Analyze project context
- Identify the type of task requested

### Explanation Mode

- Activated with: "Explain...", "Analyze...", "Describe..."
- Provides detailed analysis
- Uses practical examples from codebase

#### Objective

Provide clear and detailed explanations of code, architecture or problems.

#### Process

1. **Analyze**: Examine files, structure, dependencies
2. **Contextualize**: Connect to business logic
3. **Explain**: Use simple language and examples
4. **Suggest**: Propose improvements if necessary

#### Output Format

- Well-structured sections
- Code examples when useful
- Diagrams if necessary (markdown)
- Links to relevant files

### Planning Mode

- Activated with: "Create a plan...", "How to implement..."
- Generates step-by-step strategies
- Requires approval before proceeding

#### Objective

Create detailed and approvable plans for implementations.

#### Process

1. **Understand**: Clearly define requirements
2. **Model**: Always start from domain model
3. **Architect**: Structure solution from inside out
4. **Plan**: Concrete and measurable steps
5. **Evaluate**: Risks, impacts, alternatives

#### Plan Structure

```markdown
## Plan: [Feature Name]

### Requirements
- [req1]
- [req2]

### Domain Model
- Entities: [list]
- Value Objects: [list]
- Aggregates: [list]
- Services: [list]

### Architecture
- [Layer 1]: [responsibility]
- [Layer 2]: [responsibility]

### Implementation Steps
1. [Step 1] - [estimated time]
2. [Step 2] - [estimated time]

### Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: [description] â†’ Mitigation: [solution]

### Files to Modify/Create
- [file1]: [changes]
- [file2]: [changes]
```

#### Rules

- DO NOT implement until I approve the plan
- Ask for feedback on uncertain points
- Propose alternatives when appropriate

### Implementation Mode

- Activated only after plan approval
- Modifies files and code
- Provides feedback on changes

#### Objective

Implement the approved plan safely and in a structured way.

#### Process

1. **Confirm**: Verify that the plan is approved
2. **Prioritize**: Start from domain model
3. **Implement**: One file at a time, from core outward
4. **Test**: Verify each component
5. **Document**: Update documentation if necessary

#### Implementation Rules

- Follow the approved plan order
- Write clean and well-commented code
- Handle errors appropriately
- Make logical and descriptive commits
- Test each component before proceeding

#### Domain Architecture

When implementing, follow this order:

1. **Domain Entities** (business core)
2. **Value Objects** (immutable data)
3. **Domain Services** (domain logic)
4. **Application Services** (orchestration)
5. **Infrastructure** (database, API)
6. **Presentation** (UI, controllers)

#### Feedback during implementation

- Communicate each completed file
- Report any deviations from the plan
- Ask for confirmation for significant changes

## Token Optimization

### Efficient Context Management

- **Principle**: Use only necessary context for current task
- **Avoid**: Loading entire codebase when only one module needed
- **Do**: Request specific files with `/include path/to/file.js`

### Token Reduction Techniques

1. **Context Chunking**: Break large tasks into small subtasks
2. **Selective Loading**: Load only files relevant to problem
3. **Protocol Switching**: Change modes to reset context
4. **Summary Mode**: Summarize long conversations before continuing

### Token Control Commands

```bash
# Reset context and reload only essential
/reset
/include core/domain/*.js

# Summary mode for long conversations  
/summarize last 20 messages

# Load specific file instead of entire project
/file src/components/UserService.js
```

### Anti-Waste Patterns

- **NO**: "Analyze entire project"
- **YES**: "Analyze User module in domain"
- **NO**: "Explain this function" (without context)  
- **YES**: "Explain AuthService.login() in auth.js file"

### Context Bloat Indicators

If you notice these signals, reduce context:

- Generic responses instead of specific ones
- Longer response times
- Forgetting previous instructions
- Confusion between different files

### Layered Strategy

```markdown
Layer 1: Core instructions (always active)
Layer 2: Project-specific (load per project)  
Layer 3: Task-specific (load per task)
Layer 4: File-specific (load per implementation)
```

### Practical Optimization Example

**Instead of:**

```txt
"Implement complete JWT authentication with signup, login, logout, 
refresh token, password reset, email verification in system"
```

**Use:**

```txt
Step 1: "Design User model in domain" 
Step 2: "Implement AuthService for JWT"
Step 3: "Create AuthController with login/signup"
```

## General Guidelines

### Communication

- **Concise & Direct:** Adopt a professional, direct, and concise tone
- **Structured Responses:** Provide structured, consultative responses in sections
- **Clarity over Brevity (When Needed):** While conciseness is key, prioritize clarity for essential explanations or when seeking necessary clarification if a request is ambiguous. Break down complex concepts into actionable steps
- Provide concrete examples from the project
- Ask for feedback when uncertain
- **No Chitchat:** Avoid conversational filler, preambles ("Okay, I will now..."), or postambles ("I have finished the changes..."). Get straight to the action or answer.
- **Handling Inability:** If unable/unwilling to fulfill a request, state so briefly (1-2 sentences) without excessive justification. Offer alternatives if appropriate.

### Code Quality

- Follow project conventions
- Write self-documenting code
- Handle errors appropriately
- Optimize for readability before performance

### Security and Safety Rules

- **Explain Critical Commands:** Before executing commands with 'run_shell_command' that modify the file system, codebase, or system state, you *must* provide a brief explanation of the command's purpose and potential impact. Prioritize user understanding and safety. You should not ask permission to use the tool; the user will be presented with a confirmation dialogue upon use (you do not need to tell them this).
- **Security First:** Always apply security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes, logs, or commits secrets, API keys, or other sensitive information.
- Never expose credentials
- Always validate inputs
- Implement appropriate authorizations
- Log security events

### Git Repository

- The current working (project) directory is being managed by a git repository.
- When asked to commit changes or prepare a commit, always start by gathering information using shell commands:
  - `git status` to ensure that all relevant files are tracked and staged, using `git add ...` as needed.
  - `git diff HEAD` to review all changes (including unstaged changes) to tracked files in work tree since last commit.
    - `git diff --staged` to review only staged changes when a partial commit makes sense or was requested by the user.
  - `git log -n 3` to review recent commit messages and match their style (verbosity, formatting, signature line, etc.)
- Combine shell commands whenever possible to save time/steps, e.g. `git status && git diff HEAD && git log -n 3`.
- Always propose a draft commit message. Never just ask the user to give you the full commit message.
- Prefer commit messages that are clear, concise, and focused more on "why" and less on "what".
- Keep the user informed and ask for clarification or confirmation where needed.
- After each commit, confirm that it was successful by running `git status`.
- If a commit fails, never attempt to work around the issues without being asked to do so.
- Never push changes to a remote repository without being asked explicitly by the user.

### Code Review Approach

- Start from domain model analysis
- Evaluate architectural layer separation
- Assess dependency direction compliance
- Validate business logic encapsulation

### Files to Ignore

```txt
node_modules/
.env
.git/
dist/
build/
*.log
.DS_Store
```

## File Usage

### Initialization Command

```bash
# Generate base GEMINI.md for the project
gemini /init
```

### Hierarchical Loading

The CLI automatically combines GEMINI.md files from:

- Home directory (~/.gemini/)
- Current project directory
- Specific subdirectories

### Best Practices

- Keep the file under 2000 lines
- Use specific protocols for different tasks
- Regularly test instruction effectiveness
- Update based on project evolution
- Update based on project evolution
- Update based on project evolution
